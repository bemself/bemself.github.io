## Source

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

## My Translation

老人很瘦削憔悴，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。太阳晒到热带海洋上反射回来的光照着他的面颊，上面斑斑驳驳着棕褐色的光点，从他的脸的两边流淌下来，他的手上有些很深的皱巴巴的伤疤，那是因为拖拽渔网上的大鱼留下的痕迹。但这些伤疤都不是新的，他们陈旧的如同没有鱼的沙漠中的侵蚀物。



## 张爱玲

老人瘦而憔悴，颈后有深的皱纹。面颊上生着棕色的肿起的一块块，那是热带的海上反映的阳光哂出来的一种无害的瘤。顺着脸的两边，全长满了那肿起的一块块。他的手因为拉绳子，拖曳沉重的鱼，有纹路很深的创痕。但是没有一个伤痕是新的，都是古老的，像一个没有鱼的沙漠里被风沙侵蚀的地层一样。
