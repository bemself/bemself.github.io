He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and the sailthat was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

他是一个老人，独自划着小船在墨西哥湾打鱼，而他在过去的84天里，一条鱼也没有捕到。开始的40天有一个男孩一直跟着他。但40天后老人仍无一鱼所获，小男孩的父母就跟小男孩说，这个老人绝对而且永远也打不到鱼了，因为他运气糟糕透底了，他们吩咐小男孩跟着另一条船去打鱼，第一周就捕到了三条大鱼。看着老人每天空着船回来，小男孩很难过。他总是下去帮老人抬着渔网或者鱼钩和渔叉，收起船桅上的帆。船帆用面粉袋打着补丁，斑斑点点的，卷起来的时候就像是垂头丧气的败旗。

他是一个老头子，一个人划着一只小船在墨西哥湾大海流打鱼，而他已经有八十四天没有捕到一条鱼了。在最初的四十天里有一个男孩和他在一起。但是四十天没捕到一条鱼，那男孩的父母就告诉他说这老头子确实一定是晦气星──那是一种最最走霉运的人──于是孩子听了父母的吩咐，到另一只船上去打鱼，那只船第一个星期就捕到三条好鱼。孩子看见那老人每天驾着空船回来，心里觉得很难过，他总去帮他拿那一卷卷的钩丝，或是鱼钩和鱼叉，还有那卷在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋打着补钉；卷起来的时候，看上去像永久的失败的旗帜。
